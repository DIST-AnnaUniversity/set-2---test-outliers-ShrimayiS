import pandas as pd





#read the csv file

#find the outliers with iqr for each column
#find the column that has maximum outliers than the other column
#print the name of the column and the number of values of the column that has maximum outliers. For example, if the first column has maximum outliers with 25, the value should be printed as 'Pregnancies 25' (without inverted comma)
